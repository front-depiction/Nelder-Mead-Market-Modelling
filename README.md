# Nelder-Mead-Market-Modelling

This repository contains code and data for applying the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm to market modelling. The Nelder-Mead algorithm is a popular optimization method for finding the minimum or maximum of an objective function in multidimensional space, and has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in finance and economics.

In this repository, I provide a set of Python scripts for implementing the Nelder-Mead algorithm on financial market data, with the goal of estimating parameters for various market models. I also include several datasets for testing and benchmarking the code, as well as example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the code for common use cases.

Some of the key features of this repository include:

- Implementation of the Nelder-Mead algorithm in Python, optimized for financial market modelling
- Example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the code

I hope that this repository will be useful for researchers and practitioners interested in applying the Nelder-Mead algorithm to financial market modelling. Please feel free to use the code and data for your own research, and to contribute to the repository by submitting bug reports or pull requests.
